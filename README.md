=================================

In this project i will hack the Maisto [Rock Crawler RC car](http://www.amazon.de/Maisto-581152-Crawler-farblich-sortiert/dp/B003ML36HI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1392464428&sr=8-1&keywords=maisto+rock+crawler) attaching a Raspberry Pi to it.

You can finally access the Rock Crawler through its own WebInterface that gives you the following features:

* Steering using sliders
* See where you are driving using the Raspberry Pi camera
* ... more to come

Status
======

The project just started so I'm currently figuring out how the internal PCB of the car works.
